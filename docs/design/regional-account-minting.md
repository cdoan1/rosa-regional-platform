# Regional Account Minting Service

**Last Updated Date**: 2026-02-10

## Summary

AWS Account Minting will leverage a collection of idempotent pipelines in order to mint, bootstrap, and provision static regional accounts for a given region. We additionally define the OU structure and define which payer accounts to use for which environments:

```yaml
control:
  rosa-regional-platform:
    prod:
      prod-us-east-1
      prod-eu-west-2
      ...

staging-1:
  rosa-regional-platform:
    int:
      int-us-east-2
    stage:
      stage-us-east-1
      stage-eu-west-2
      ...

staging-2:
  rosa-regional-platform:
    dev:
      dev-kirk-us-east-2
      dev-pete-eu-west-1
      ...
```

## Context

In order to provide a secure but repeatable environment that can be appropriately governed we need to define the structure of how we will group AWS Accounts within our payer-account structure per-environment as well as how to define the criteria for the scope of the individual pipelines. Specific implementation details on the pipelines may change from the illustrative examples contained within this document, but the definition of what pipeline to use for what actions, and which context those pipelines will be running under is the important bits here.

## Design

The high-level design for the account-minting pipelines looks as follows:

![Regional Account Minting Design](/docs/design/assets/regional-account-minting-design.png "Account Minting Design")

There are three main classes of pipelines that will run from the central account:

- Account Minting
- Account Bootstrapping
- Account Provisioning

Each of these pipelines should be idempotent. They should be run at regular intervals that will ensure that there is no configuration drift. However as we build these individual pipelines as independent pieces they should be able to be run out-of-band at any time in order to do things like apply updates, create new regions, etc.

### Account Minting Pipeline

The Account Minting pipeline is responsible for the creation of the AWS Account and ensuring that the AWS accounts are in the correct OU, and have the correct tagging structure applied. This runs in the context of a role on the Payer Account itself that has the necessary permissions.

### Account Bootstrapping Pipeline

The Account Bootstrapping pipeline is responsible for the application of the individual resources necessary for other downstream pipelines to be run. At this time this includes the initial IAM Role setup, but can be further expanded as necessary. This pipeline runs in the context of the OrganizationAccountAccessRole on the individual regional account, chaining that access through the payer account. Because of the enhanced level of access this pipeline will have, we should limit this to the bare-minimum amount of resource creation that we need in order to run the provisioning pipeline successfully.

### Account Provisioning Pipeline

The Account Provisioning pipelines are the class of pipelines that are to be run against the various different accounts based on the account's role within a region. At the time of this writing there are two types of provisioning pipelines: Regional Cluster and Management Cluster. This number will expand over time, as we will further add log aggregation accounts, DR accounts, etc. Each pipeline will ensure that the correct resources for that account's role are added, and will further handle any additional setup as necessary. For example, the regional-cluster pipeline will apply the terraform necessary to create the regional EKS cluster, but then will have a further step to apply the helm charts so that it comes online with no further human interaction, etc.

> **Note:** This document covers static MC provisioning only, where MC accounts are pre-created as part of the region setup. Dynamic MC provisioning (on-demand scaling of MCs in response to capacity needs) is out of scope and will be addressed in a future design.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **AWS Control Tower**: AWS Control Tower provides a governance abstraction on new account minting. However this does not apply any new resources and is extremely web-console click-heavy, which would limit our ability to automate account minting at any kind of scale.
2. **AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)**: AFT was considered, however this AWS Solution deploys a lengthy set of resources onto the target AWS Account. Without extensive experimentation, there's no indication that this can be deployed across multiple separate regions and/or load-balanced for any kind of regional-failover. There is also an additional maintenance burden, similar to any self-built solution since this is just a packaged AWS solution and not specifically an AWS hosted service.

## Design Rationale

- **Justification**: The solution as defined will allow us the same amount of flexibility that AWS Account Factory for Terraform offers without the extensive overhead of the deployed AWS Solution. The OU structure as defined will also allow us to leverage SCPs in order to further define governance policies based on environment (for example, if we want to leverage a [Multi-party approval process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mpa/latest/userguide/what-is.html) for break-glass into production clusters, while keeping int/stage environments on-demand break-glass). We further break each "region" into its own OU, so that we can further leverage AWS IAM Role conditions to [only allow access from within that OU](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-control-access-to-aws-resources-based-on-aws-account-ou-or-organization/).

## Consequences

### Positive

- Idempotent pipelines allow the ability to run the pipelines as the process to apply changes as well as to ensure there's no configuration drift.
- Pipelines that are broken down into multiple, reusable pieces allow for the same processes to be used for future account provisioning services, such as on-demand scaling which may not go through the same global minting terraform service.

### Negative

- We must define and maintain the whole pipeline architecture
- We need to be the ones to define observability, since there's no out-of-the-box solution for this

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Multi-Cloud Compatibility

- This account minting design is specific to AWS and cannot be reused with Managed OpenShift on other cloud providers. Future implementations for additional cloud providers will require separate design and pipeline architecture.


### Reliability

- **Scalability**: Since this solution leverages AWS-native services we should be able to "infinitely" scale, up to any cloud-provider limits.
- **Observability**: We need to ensure that we have and are able to export proper signal for reporting purposes and future debugability assuming something goes wrong.
- **Resiliency**: New Region creation will be limited if the AWS Services that run the pipelines or hold the S3 State are impacted. However, new regions will not often be created, so this may not be a concern.

### Security

- This solution will implement a least-privileged access model, as well as short-lived AWS IAM role credentials for all operations.

### Performance

- Care should be taken that any pipelines that can run in parallel during new-region creation can be. Our goal is to create a new region within an hour. For example, we can parallelize RC and MC cluster creation using a fan-out pattern, and then come back after those jobs are completed to register the MCs as consumers within the RC's Maestro instance.

### Cost

- Cost depends on the pipeline runner chosen (which is out of scope for this document). The expected run volumes are:
  - **Account Minting Pipeline**: 40 regions × ~6-7 accounts per region = ~240-280 pipeline runs. Changes are infrequent.
  - **Account Bootstrapping Pipeline**: 1:1 with Account Minting, so ~240-280 pipeline runs. Changes are infrequent.
  - **Account Provisioning Pipeline**: 1 run per region for the RC, plus 1 per MC. Estimating ~10 MCs per region with ~1 weekly configuration change, this amounts to ~400 weekly runs (10 MCs × 40 regions).

### Operability

- We will need to consider how easy it will be to debug failures, as well as surface issues.
